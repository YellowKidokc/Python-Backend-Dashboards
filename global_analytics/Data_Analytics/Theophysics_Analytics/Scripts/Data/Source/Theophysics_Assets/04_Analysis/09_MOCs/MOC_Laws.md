# Laws MOC

> **Doctrinal Principles** - Validated, universal truths of Theophysics.

---

## What is a Law?

A **Law** is a principle that:
- Has universal scope (applies everywhere)
- Has been validated through multiple lines of evidence
- Produces testable predictions
- Integrates physics and theology coherently

---

## Current Laws

```dataview
TABLE
  validation_status AS Status,
  coherence_score AS Coherence,
  predictive_power AS "Predictive Power"
FROM "05_Doctrine"
WHERE type = "law"
SORT coherence_score DESC
```

---

## The Master Equation

The central law of Theophysics:

$$
\chi = f(I, F, D, G, S)
$$

Where:
- **χ (chi)** = Logos Field strength
- **I** = Information (Father aspect)
- **F** = Form (Son aspect)
- **D** = Dynamics (Spirit aspect)
- **G** = Grace (negentropic force)
- **S** = Entropy (decay force)

See: [[LAW_Master_Equation]]

## Law Hierarchy

```
MASTER EQUATION (χ)
        |
   ┌────┴────┐
   |         |
DERIVED    DERIVED
 LAW 1      LAW 2
   |         |
Predictions Predictions
```

## Planned Laws

| Law | Based On | Prediction Domain |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| Law of Grace-Entropy Opposition | Grace (G), Entropy (S) | Thermodynamic theology |
| Law of Trinity Coherence | I, F, D | Structural relationships |
| Law of Resurrection | R, G, S | Entropy reversal conditions |
| Law of Observer Participation | Consciousness, Collapse | Measurement theology |

## Creating New Laws

Use template: `[[03_Templates/05_Doctrine_Template]]`

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Mathematical formulation
- [ ] Physical interpretation
- [ ] Theological interpretation
- [ ] Multiple independent confirmations
- [ ] Predictive success record
- [ ] No contradictions with established laws

## Law Statistics

```dataviewjs
const laws = dv.pages('"05_Doctrine"').where(p => p.type == "law");
const validated = laws.where(p => p.validation_status == "validated").length;

dv.paragraph(`**Total Laws:** ${laws.length}`);
dv.paragraph(`**Validated:** ${validated}`);
dv.paragraph(`**Pending:** ${laws.length - validated}`);
```
