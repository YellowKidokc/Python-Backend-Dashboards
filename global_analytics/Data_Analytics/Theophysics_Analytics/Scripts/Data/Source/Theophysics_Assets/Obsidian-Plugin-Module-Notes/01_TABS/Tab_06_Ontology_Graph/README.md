# Tab 6: Ontology & Concept Graph

**Purpose**: Structural backbone showing how all concepts relate to each other.

**Group**: Structural Analysis  
**Priority**: Phase 2

---

## Overview

This tab displays the concept graph with nodes (terms, entities) and edges (relationships like is-a, part-of, implies, depends-on).

---

## Core Functions

### 1. Concept Nodes
- All terms and variables as nodes
- Definitions and aliases
- First-seen dates
- Usage tracking

### 2. Relationship Edges
- is-a (taxonomy)
- part-of (composition)
- implies (logical)
- depends-on (dependency)
- causes (causal)
- contradicts (conflict)
- precedes (temporal)

### 3. Graph Visualization
- Interactive network graph
- Filterable by theory, domain, relationship type
- Zoom and pan
- Export capabilities

### 4. Health Metrics
- Node count
- Edge count
- Orphan detection (unconnected nodes)
- Cycle detection
- Structural coherence
