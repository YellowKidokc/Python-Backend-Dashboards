# Master Truth Folder Architecture

**Purpose**: Central repository tracking all knowledge, metrics, and progression over time.

**Location**: `/master-truth/` at vault root

---

## Core Principle

The Master Truth folder is your **global snapshot** of everything the system knows. Each category within it has its own dedicated dashboard that tracks progression, accumulation, and historical trends.

---

## Folder Structure

## Master Sheet

**File**: `master-sheet.md`

**Purpose**: Single auto-generated markdown file that serves as the global index of everything the system knows.

**Contents**:
1. **Concepts (Glossary)**: All terms with definitions, first-seen dates, source notes
2. **Mathematical Objects**: All equations with LaTeX, English summary, creator, UUID
3. **Axioms**: All axioms with theory assignment, coherence score, contradiction status
4. **Evidence**: All evidence with support chains and confidence ratings
5. **Claims**: All claims with verification status
6. **Theories Combined**: Internal and external theories with conflict counts
7. **Timeline Events**: All events with dates, sources, conflict flags
8. **External Links**: All SEP/Wikipedia links with relevance mapping
9. **Breakthroughs**: Chronological log of major insights
10. **NEW Items Section**: What's been added since last update

**Regeneration**: On every vault scan, with history preserved in `/history/`

**weekly-summary.md** (auto-generated narrative):
```markdown
## Weekly Summary: Jan 8-14, 2025

This week you added 12 new concepts and 3 axioms. The Lowe Coherence Lagrangian improved from 0.798 to 0.847, primarily due to resolving the timeline conflict between events ev003 and ev007.

Key breakthrough: Formalization of grace as negentropic correction (brk001).

Action items for next week:
- Define 6 terms still marked as undefined
- Address 2 remaining axiom contradictions
- Add evidence for 4 unsupported claims
```

## Integration with Plugin

The plugin generates and maintains this entire folder structure automatically:

**On Every Scan**:
- `master-sheet.md` is regenerated
- Timestamped copy goes to `/history/`

**On Every Change**:
- Relevant sub-dashboard is updated
- Add a new axiom? `/axioms/axiom-registry.md` and `/axioms/axioms-dashboard.md` update

**Daily/Weekly**:
- `/progression/` folder generates summary reports

**JSON Files**:
- Store raw data that markdown dashboards visualize
- These are what PostgreSQL mirrors for advanced analytics

---

## Why This Structure Matters

**For Researchers**:
- See exactly how your thinking has evolved
- Every axiom, term, breakthrough has a timestamp and trail

**For Collaboration**:
- Share `/master-truth/` folder and collaborators instantly understand your framework's current state and history

**For Export**:
- This folder is self-contained
- Zip it and the recipient has everything—no database needed

**For Debugging**:
- When coherence drops, trace back through history to find what changed

**For Motivation**:
- Watch your concept count grow, coherence score improve, breakthroughs accumulate
