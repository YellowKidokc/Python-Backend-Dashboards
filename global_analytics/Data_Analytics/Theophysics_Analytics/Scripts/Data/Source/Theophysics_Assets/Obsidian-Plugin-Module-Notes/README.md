# Theophysics Semantic Research Engine

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Design & Documentation Phase  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15  
**Repository**: https://github.com/YellowKidokc/Obsidian-Plugin-Module-Notes

---

## What Is This?

The **Theophysics Semantic Research Engine** is a Glass Box research environment for Obsidian that transforms a vault of notes into a coherent, testable, self-auditing knowledge system.

**Not just a plugin—a semantic research operating system.**

### The Core Innovation

Users write naturally in Markdown. Behind the scenes, AI parses everything—math, axioms, timelines, theories, evidence—and stores structured semantic meaning in hidden blocks within each note. All knowledge is portable, exportable, and reconstructable without any proprietary database.

### What Makes It Different

- **Unified Semantic Model**: Single graph connecting tags, links, definitions, math, ontology, axioms, evidence
- **Epistemic Typing**: Every statement classified as axiom, claim, evidence, definition
- **Coherence Checking**: Uses the Lowe Coherence Lagrangian to measure framework health
- **Portable by Design**: All semantics live in markdown—no lock-in
- **AI-Native**: Built for AI collaboration with Claude and GPT
- **Glass Box Architecture**: The hidden semantic layer becomes visible and navigable

## Design Philosophy

This plugin is built on these core principles:

1. **Markdown is Source of Truth**: Everything can be reconstructed from the vault
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Modules are independent; failures don't cascade
3. **AI-Native**: Built for AI collaboration from the ground up
4. **Portable by Design**: No proprietary lock-in; all semantics live in markdown
5. **Theory-Building Focus**: Designed for complex multi-theory frameworks
6. **Coherence as First-Class**: Uses Lowe Coherence Lagrangian for principled scoring

## Key Features

### Unified Semantic Model
Single graph connecting tags, links, definitions, math, ontology, axioms, evidence across the entire vault.

### Epistemic Typing
Every statement can be classified as axiom, claim, evidence, definition, giving the system logical structure.

### Coherence Checking
System tells you whether your ideas hang together, using the Lowe Coherence Lagrangian.

### Multi-Model AI
Claude handles strategy, GPT handles parsing. Both maintain persistent understanding.

### PostgreSQL Mirror
Optional database for advanced analytics. Not required for basic functionality.

### Master Truth Folder
Central repository tracking all knowledge, metrics, and progression over time.

## Contributing

This is currently in the design phase. Documentation is being created using the **Data Dump Processing Methodology** (see `D:\THEOPHYSICS_MASTER\02_LIBRARY\Prompts\Data_Dump_Processing_Methodology.md`).

As conversations and design sessions occur, they are processed into structured documentation following that methodology.

**Note**: This is a living documentation system. Documents are created as outlines and filled in as design decisions are made and implementation progresses. The structure supports iterative refinement and collaborative development.
