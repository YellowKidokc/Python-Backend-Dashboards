# Theophysics Semantic Research Engine
## Complete Plugin Overview

**Purpose**: Transform an Obsidian vault into a coherent, testable, self-auditing knowledge system for academic research.

**Core Innovation**: Users write naturally in Markdown. AI parses everything—math, axioms, timelines, theories, evidence—and stores structured semantic meaning in hidden blocks within each note. All knowledge is portable, exportable, and reconstructable without any proprietary database.

---

## Executive Summary

This is not a simple Obsidian plugin. It is a **semantic research operating system** that transforms a vault of notes into a coherent, testable, self-auditing knowledge system.

### What It Does
- Detects and classifies axioms, claims, evidence, definitions, events, and theories
- Builds a unified knowledge graph connecting all concepts
- Computes coherence using the [[Lowe Coherence Lagrangian]]
- Identifies contradictions, gaps, and breakthrough insights
- Syncs to PostgreSQL for advanced analytics
- Maintains AI workspace with persistent understanding

### Who It's For
- **Researchers**: Building complex theoretical frameworks
- **Theologians**: Integrating faith and reason systematically
- **Physicists**: Developing new theories with mathematical rigor
- **Philosophers**: Constructing logically consistent arguments
- **Anyone**: Creating multi-theory knowledge systems

## Architecture Overview

### Four Fundamental Layers

**Layer 0: Obsidian + Vault**  
Raw markdown notes, images, files. This is what the user sees and edits.

**Layer 1: Extraction & Annotation**  
AI-powered parsing that detects axioms, claims, evidence, math, timelines, terms, and theories. Each piece gets a UUID and is stored in hidden semantic blocks within the markdown.

**Layer 2: Normalization & Graph**  
Unifies tags, links, ontology nodes, definitions, events, and math into a single knowledge graph. PostgreSQL mirrors this for analytics but is not the source of truth.

**Layer 3: Analytics, Coherence & Visualization**  
Dashboards, coherence scoring (via the Lowe Coherence Lagrangian), breakthrough detection, cross-theory conflict identification, and exportable reports.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Unified Semantic Model
Not point solutions—a single graph connecting tags, links, definitions, math, ontology, axioms, evidence across the entire vault.

### 2. Epistemic Typing
Not just "text"—every statement can be classified as axiom, claim, evidence, definition, giving the system logical structure.

### 3. Coherence Checking
Not just search—the system tells you whether your ideas hang together, using the [[Lowe Coherence Lagrangian]] as a principled variational foundation.

### 4. Portable by Design
All semantics live in markdown. No proprietary lock-in. Export your vault and everything travels with it.

### 5. AI-Native
Built for AI collaboration from the ground up, with structured prompts, provider flexibility, and continuous learning.

### 6. Theory-Building Focus
Designed for researchers constructing complex multi-theory frameworks—not just note-taking.

## Fault Tolerance Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Markdown is always the source of truth.

- PostgreSQL is a mirror/index, not the canonical store
- Each module can run independently
- Failures are isolated, logged, but don't cascade
- System continues in degraded mode if components fail
- One-button reconstruction from vault

See: [[Architecture_Fault_Tolerance|Fault Tolerance Architecture]]

---

## Master Truth Folder

The `/master-truth/` folder contains:
- **master-sheet.md** - Unified overview of all knowledge
- Sub-dashboards for each metric (concepts, math, axioms, evidence, claims, timeline, theories, coherence, breakthroughs)
- Historical snapshots with timestamps
- Progression analytics showing research velocity

See: [[Master_Truth_Architecture|Master Truth Folder Architecture]]

---

## AI Integration

**Multi-Model Orchestration**:
- **Claude**: Strategic overseer, high-level understanding, breakthrough detection
- **GPT**: Analytical workhorse, document parsing, extraction

**Persistent Understanding**:
- AI maintains its own notes in `/ai-workspace/`
- Tracks understanding, observations, questions, suggestions
- Session logs for full transparency
- Handoff protocol between models

See: [[AI_Integration_Architecture|AI Integration Architecture]]

---

## PostgreSQL Schema

Complete database schema with tables for:
- Items (universal UUID system)
- Concepts, Axioms, Claims, Evidence
- Math objects, Variables, Timeline events
- Theories, External links, Relationships
- Coherence history, Breakthroughs
- AI sessions, AI understanding snapshots

See: [[PostgreSQL_Schema|PostgreSQL Schema Documentation]]
