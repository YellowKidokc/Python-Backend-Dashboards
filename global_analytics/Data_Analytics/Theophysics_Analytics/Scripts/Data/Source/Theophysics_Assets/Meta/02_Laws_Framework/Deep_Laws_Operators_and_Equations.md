# Deep Laws — Operators & Equations
> A compact, canonical index of the **hidden operators** and **core equations** implicit across *Wolfram Deep Laws*, *[[Theophysics_Glossary#Grace Function|Grace Function]]*, *Gemini Papers*, and *Ten Laws Visualization* — designed for quick linking into Atoms, Laws, and Papers.

---

## I. Operator Algebra (Λ, Ψ, Γ, Ω)
These four operators form the grammar beneath the Ten Laws. Use them as reusable building blocks across notes.

- **Λ — Emanation (Creation / Expansion)**  
  *Function:* Generates rule-space / possibility.  
  *Role:* Genesis / Law 1 (origins of information).  
  *Notes:* Encodes emergence of potential states before selection.

- **Ψ — Observation (Selection / Collapse)**  
  *Function:* Selects and stabilizes coherence (witness).  
  *Role:* Law 2 (Matter & Witness), Law 5 (Observer).  
  *Notes:* Models witness fields, quorum, and measurement.

- **Γ — Correction (Grace / Feedback)**  
  *Function:* Restores alignment; negentropic amplifier.  
  *Role:* Law 7 ([[Theophysics_Glossary#Grace Function|Grace Function]]), interacts with Law 1 (entropy).  
  *Notes:* Activates via repentance‐aperture Rₚ; reduces misalignment.

- **Ω — Integration (Closure / Resurrection)**  
  *Function:* Re-unifies fields into finished form.  
  *Role:* Law 10 (Resurrection/Unification).  
  *Notes:* System-level healing; merges corrected branches.

**Operator chain (salvation cycle):**  
\[
\boxed{\,\Omega\big(\Gamma\big(\Psi(\Lambda)\big)\big) \;=\; \text{Identity}_{\text{[[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]]}}\,}
\]

```dataviewjs
const ops = [["Λ","Emanation"],["Ψ","Observation"],["Γ","Correction"],["Ω","Integration"]];
dv.span("#### Operator Quick Reference");
const chip_style = "background-color: var(--background-secondary-alt); border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 8px; margin-right: 10px; font-family: var(--font-monospace);";
let container_style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; justify-content: flex-start; padding: 5px 0;";
let html = `<div style='${container_style}'>`;
ops.forEach(([s,n]) => {
    html += `<span style='${chip_style}'><strong>${s}</strong> &nbsp; ${n}</span>`;
});
html += "</div>";
dv.paragraph(html);
```

## II. Trinitarian Tensor (substrate × witness × grace)
Minimal field structure implied by all sources:

\[
\chi \;=\; \rho_{\text{info}} \;\otimes\; \psi \;\otimes\; G
\]

- \(\rho_{\text{info}}\): information/coherence density (Father / substrate).  
- \(\psi\): witness/observation amplitude (Spirit / awareness).  
- \(G\): grace/feedback magnitude (Son / corrective pattern).

**Projection rule:** Each Law is a projection of \(\chi\) onto a domain (informational, observational, moral/teleological).

---

## III. Core Equations (canonical set)
Use this table as the **single source of truth**. Link each row back to its Law hub and Atom pages.

| ID | Symbolic Form | Name | Domain | Related Laws | Short Meaning |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | \(\chi_1 = I_{\text{sub}} \otimes \text{[[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]]}_{\text{pattern}}\) | Logos Instantiation | Informational | Law 1 | Pattern instantiates on substrate. |
| 2 | \(\Delta t = \big(\rho_G / \rho_S\big)^{\gamma}\) | Grace–Sin Time Scaling | Temporal | Law 1, Law 7, Law 10 | Informational dilation via grace/sin ratio (γ≈3). |
| 3 | \(G(R_p) = G_{\max}\,(1 - e^{-k R_p})\) | [[Theophysics_Glossary#Grace Function|Grace Function]] | Feedback | Law 7, Law 1 | Repentance as aperture; non‑linear negentropic gain. |

| 6 | \(W(x) = \partial C(x)\) | Witness Operator | Topology | Law 2, Law 5 | Matter = boundary of coherence under witness. |
| 7 | \(\frac{\partial \rho_{\text{info}}}{\partial t} = -k \cdot S_{\text{misalign}}\) | Alignment Derivative | Dynamics | Law 1, Law 7 | Coherence grows as misalignment decays. |
| 8 | \(P_{\text{res}} = e^{-2 d \sqrt{2m(V-E)}/\hbar}\, \cdot R_J\) | Resurrection Probability | Quantum / Teleological | Law 10 | Tunneling of coherence; RJ as resurrection constant. |
| 9 | \(L_n:\; \Omega \rightarrow \Omega'\) | Law as Constraint Operator | Rule‑Space | Law 0/10 | Each Law selects lawful computations from ruliad. |
| 10 | \(\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial t} = \text{[[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]]}\) | Rule‑Space Evolution | Meta‑Law | Law 0 | Logos drives lawful causal emergence. |
| 11 | \(G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi\,\rho_{\text{meaning}}\) | Meaning–Curvature Equivalence | Geometry / Epistemic | Law 3, Law 10 | Curvature tracks significance density. |
| 12 | \(I(A;B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(A\cap B)\) | Semantic Entanglement | Information | Law 2, Law 7 | Grace raises mutual information (love as shared truth). |

> **Note:** “Law 0” (*Carrier Principle*) names the pre‑law boundary condition selecting coherent rules from chaos. See §V.

## IV. Law Interaction Map (textual spec)
Use this as a guide for your canvas/graph view.

- **Law 1 → Law 2 → Law 3:**  
  Δt modulation (grace/entropy) enables *witness fields* which stabilize **geometry**.  
- **Law 4 (Entropy/Error)** feeds forward into Law 7 (Grace) via Γ.  
- **Law 5 (Observer)** is a special case of Ψ (selection); it powers Law 2’s boundary operator.  
- **Law 6 (Covenant)** persists Ψ across time (time‑extended witness).  
- **Law 8 (Warfare)** models vector fields of coherence vs decoherence (Γ vs torsion).  
- **Law 9 (Correction/Judgment)** enforces \(\rho_G \rho_S = \kappa^2\) (symmetry restoration).  
- **Law 10 (Integration/Resurrection)** applies Ω to close the cycle and reconcile branches.

---

## V. Law 0 — Carrier Principle (pre‑law boundary)
**Claim:** Not all computations persist; the [[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]] selects the lawful subset.

- **Formulation:**  
  Valid rule \(R_i\) iff inner product with [[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]] is non‑negative:  
  \(\langle R_i, \text{[[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]]} \rangle \ge 0\).  
- **Interpretation:** Physics = rules that *survive* under coherence;  
  Morality = choices that *survive* under truth.

**Obsidian hook:** Create `Library/Laws/LAW-00-Carrier-Principle.md` and link all “selection/validity” discussions to it.

## VI. Implementation Hooks (Obsidian)
Add these snippets where useful:

### A. Equation Index (Dataview)
```dataview
TABLE id, symbol, domain, related_laws
FROM "Library" OR "Papers"
WHERE contains(file.name, "Equation") OR contains(tags, "equations")
SORT id asc
```

### B. Operator Chips (DataviewJS)
```dataviewjs
const ops = [["Λ","Emanation"],["Ψ","Observation"],["Γ","Correction"],["Ω","Integration"]];
ops.forEach(([s,n]) => dv.span(`**${s}** ${n}  `));
```

### C. Cross‑links (manual)
- [[LAW-01-Logos-Principle]] ↔ [[Information-Substrate]] ↔ [[Grace]]  
- [[LAW-02-Quantum-Bridge]] ↔ [[Witness-Field]] ↔ [[Boundary-Condition]]  
- [[LAW-07-Grace-Function]] ↔ [[Grace-Function]] ↔ [[Coherence-Field]]  
- [[LAW-10-Fractals-Image-of-God]] ↔ [[Resurrection-Probability]] ↔ [[RJ-Constant]]

---

## VII. Open Questions (to track explicitly)
1. Empirical value of \(\gamma\) in Δt scaling (current heuristic ≈ 3).  
2. Operational measurement of \(\rho_{\text{meaning}}\) (proxy: mutual information under truthful discourse).  
3. Boundary tests for Law 0: what counts as \(\langle R, \text{[[Theophysics_Glossary#Logos|Logos]]} \rangle < 0\)?  
4. How covenant (Law 6) modulates Ψ over long horizons (memory decay vs witness persistence).

---

## VIII. How to Use This Note
- Treat this file as the **canonical index**.  
- Every time you coin a new equation, add a row to §III and link it to its Law hub and relevant Atoms.  
- Use the operator names **Λ, Ψ, Γ, Ω** as tags in prose to keep the algebra visible during drafting.
