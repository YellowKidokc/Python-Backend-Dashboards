## ABSTRACT

We propose a Minimal Viable Experiment (MVE) to test the Resonant Coupling Hypothesis (RCH), which predicts that structured information couples to physical systems proportionally to algorithmic mutual information I_A(s; M_X). Using an off-the-shelf Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), we will test whether bitstream entropy is measurably modulated by input information of varying Kolmogorov Complexity. Success requires demonstration of monotonic relationship between input complexity and output entropy across a 4-rung calibration ladder, culminating in a blinded test of ancient Hebrew scripture. The experiment is designed with cryptographic pre-commitment, null-model ensemble testing, and clear falsification criteria at every stage.

---

## SECTION 1: THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

### 1.1 The Resonant Coupling Hypothesis

The RCH posits:

$$
\Delta O = \kappa I_A(s; M_X)^\nu \Phi_X + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- ΔO = Change in observable
- I_A(s; M_X) = Algorithmic mutual information between input s and system model M_X
- κ, ν = Coupling parameters (to be fit)
- Φ_X = System susceptibility
- ε = Noise term

### 1.2 Information Resonance Metric (IRM)

For convenience, we define:

$$
\text{IRM}(s) = \frac{\alpha}{K(s)} \cdot C(s)^\beta
$$

With I_A(s; M_X) ≈ γ₁ IRM(s) - γ₂ IRM(s|M̄_X)

### 1.3 Specific Hypothesis for QRNG

**H₁ (RCH):** QRNG output entropy H varies monotonically with IRM of modulating bitstream:

$$
H_{\text{output}} = H_0 - \eta \cdot \text{IRM}(s)^\nu
$$

**H₀ (Null):** No relationship between IRM and entropy

**Bayes Factor Decision:**
- BF₁₀ > 10³ → Provisional support for H₁
- BF₁₀ > 10⁶ → Strong support, proceed to replication
- BF₁₀ < 0.1 → Retire H₁

---

## SECTION 3: THE FOUR-RUNG LADDER

### RUNG A: Synthetic Baseline

**Purpose:** Establish that physical system responds monotonically to IRM

**Inputs (N=100,000 blocks each):**

| Input Type | K(s) | C(s) | IRM | Expected Rank |
|------------|------|------|-----|---------------|
| White noise | → ∞ | 0 | 0 | 1 (baseline) |
| LFSR-256 | High | Low | 0.1 | 2 |
| π digits | Med | Low | 0.3 | 3 |
| Thue-Morse | Low | Med | 0.6 | 4 |
| Palindromes-5 | V.Low | High | 0.9 | 5 |

**Pre-registered Analysis:**

1. Compute per-block entropy Ĥᵢ for each input type
2. Rank-order by mean entropy: E[Ĥ | input_type]
3. Test monotonicity: Spearman ρ between IRM_rank and H_rank

**Success Criterion:**
- Spearman ρ > 0.8 with p < 0.001
- Monotonic trend visible in boxplot

**Failure Criterion:**
- ρ < 0.3 or p > 0.05 → **STOP - Publish null, end program**

**Pre-fit Scaling Law:**

Fit:
$$
\Delta H = \eta \cdot \text{IRM}^\nu
$$

Via non-linear least squares on Rung A data.

**Commit:** η, ν locked before Rung B/C/D

---

### RUNG B: Text Degradation Curve

**Purpose:** Test that Hebrew text follows same scaling law as synthetics

**Hebrew Input:** Genesis 1-11 (Masoretic Text, consonantal)
- Encoding: UTF-8 → 2-bit (ACGT-like)
- Length: ~25 kilobytes

**Degradation Sequence:**

1. **Original** (IRM ≈ 0.85, estimated)
2. **No vowels** (consonants only, IRM ≈ 0.75)
3. **Bigram shuffle** (preserves local stats, IRM ≈ 0.4)
4. **Unigram shuffle** (preserves letter freq, IRM ≈ 0.15)
5. **Byte permutation** (random, IRM ≈ 0.05)

**Prediction (using Rung A fit η, ν):**

$$
H_{\text{predicted}} = H_0 - \eta \cdot \text{IRM}(degraded)^\nu
$$

**No refitting allowed**

**Analysis:**

1. Measure H_observed for each degradation level
2. Compare to H_predicted
3. Compute residuals: |H_obs - H_pred|

**Success Criterion:**
- Mean absolute error < 2σ of Rung A residuals
- Degradation curve monotonic (no inversions)

**Failure Criterion:**
- Hebrew behaves like random permutation (IRM ≈ 0)
- Residuals > 5σ → Model fails

---

### RUNG C: Model-Match Cross-overs

**Purpose:** Verify effect is system-model dependent

**Procedure:**

1. Take same Hebrew Genesis bitstream
2. Apply to THREE different physical systems:
   - System X₁: QRNG (current setup)
   - System X₂: Josephson junction phase noise (if available)
   - System X₃: Optical cavity linewidth (if available)

**Prediction:**

Different systems → different M_X → different I_A(s; M_X) → different slopes

Expected:
- η₁ (QRNG) ≠ η₂ (Josephson) ≠ η₃ (Optical)

**Analysis:**

Confidence intervals on η for each system must NOT overlap if RCH is correct.

**Note:** This rung is **optional** for MVE but recommended for full program

---

### RUNG D: Competing Corpora (Blinded)

**Purpose:** Test if Hebrew is unique or all ancient texts behave similarly

**Inputs (N=50,000 blocks each):**

1. Hebrew Torah (Masoretic, consonantal)
2. Greek New Testament (Textus Receptus)
3. Quran (Classical Arabic)
4. Rig Veda (Sanskrit)
5. Dead Sea Scrolls (1QIsa variant)
6. Modern Hebrew novel (control)
7. Lorem ipsum (Latin placeholder, control)
8. Transformer-generated "Hebrew-like" (control)

**Blinding Protocol:**

1. All texts encoded, hashed, labeled A-H
2. Labels escrowed with third party
3. Analysis performed on letter-codes only
4. Reveal after analysis complete

**Pre-committed Analysis:**

Apply Rung A fit (η, ν) to all inputs:

$$
\Delta H_{\text{predicted}} = \eta \cdot \text{IRM}(text)^\nu
$$

Rank texts by predicted effect size.

**Hypothesis:**

- If Logos framework correct: Masoretic Hebrew shows largest effect
- If general "ancient sacred text" effect: Torah ≈ Quran ≈ Veda
- If null: All ≈ controls

**Decision Tree:**

| Outcome | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Torah > others > controls | Specific Logos claim supported |
| Torah ≈ Quran ≈ Veda > controls | General "sacred text" effect |
| All ≈ controls | No effect, RCH fails for texts |

**Success for Logos Framework:**
- Masoretic Torah in top 2 of 8
- Effect size > 3σ above controls
- Bayes Factor vs. uniform null > 10³

---

## SECTION 4: NULL-MODEL ENSEMBLE

Every input must survive four null tests:

### 4.1 Permutation Nulls

For each text input s:
1. Generate 100 permuted surrogates preserving bigram statistics
2. Measure effect size for each: Δ_surrogate
3. Compare real effect Δ_real to surrogate distribution

**Pass criterion:** Δ_real > 95th percentile of surrogates

### 4.2 Generator Nulls

For Hebrew:
1. Train GPT-2 on Hebrew Bible
2. Generate synthetic "Hebrew-like" texts matching token statistics
3. Test if synthetic = real

**Pass criterion:** Real Hebrew effect > synthetic by >2σ

### 4.3 Hardware Nulls

**Sham Modulation:**
- DAC active, coil disconnected
- Bitstream sent to driver, no magnetic field
- QRNG should show no effect

**Pass criterion:** |Δ_sham| < σ_noise

### 4.4 Analysis Nulls

**Label-Swap Test:**
1. Randomly swap labels on 20% of blocks
2. Analyst performs analysis blind
3. Compare detected effect to true labels

**Pass criterion:** True labels show >5σ stronger effect than swapped

---

## SECTION 5: PRE-REGISTERED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

### 5.1 Primary Outcome

**Observable:** Per-block Shannon entropy

$$
\hat{H}_i = -\sum_{b \in \{0,1\}} \hat{p}_b \log_2 \hat{p}_b
$$

Estimated via block-wise bit frequency

### 5.2 Secondary Outcomes

1. **Compression ratio:** CR = |compressed| / |original| (gzip, bz2, LZMA)
2. **Autocorrelation:** ACF at lag 1, 10, 100 bits
3. **Spectral density:** Power spectrum via FFT

### 5.3 Pre-Specified Models

**Model 1 (RCH):**

$$
H_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{IRM}(s_i) + \beta_2 T_i + \epsilon_i
$$

Where T_i = temperature at block i (covariate)

**Model 2 (Scaled RCH):**

$$
H_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{IRM}(s_i)^\nu + \beta_2 T_i + \epsilon_i
$$

With ν from Rung A

**Model 0 (Null):**

$$
H_i = \beta_0 + \beta_2 T_i + \epsilon_i
$$

### 5.4 Model Comparison

Compute:
1. Bayes Factors: BF₁₀, BF₂₀
2. AIC/BIC for nested comparison
3. Cross-validated R²

**Decision:**
- BF₁₀ or BF₂₀ > 10³ → RCH supported
- Both < 1 → Null favored

### 5.5 Effect Size

Cohen's d for difference between high-IRM and low-IRM groups:

$$
d = \frac{\bar{H}_{\text{high}} - \bar{H}_{\text{low}}}{s_{\text{pooled}}}
$$

**Minimum detectable:** d = 0.01 at 80% power, α = 0.001

### 5.6 Sensitivity Analysis

**Robustness checks:**
1. Outlier removal (Tukey's fences)
2. Block-bootstrap confidence intervals
3. Permutation test (10,000 iterations)
4. Bayesian hierarchical model with varying intercepts

All must agree within factor of 2 on effect size.

---

## SECTION 6: CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRE-COMMITMENT

### 6.1 What Gets Hashed

**Before any data collection:**

1. This entire protocol document (PDF)
2. Analysis code (Python scripts, Git commit hash)
3. Input sequences (all bitstreams, SHA-256 each)
4. Block randomization schedule (seed + PRNG algorithm)
5. Decision thresholds (BF cutoffs, p-values, effect sizes)

**Combined hash:**

```
SHA-256(protocol || code || inputs || schedule || thresholds)
```

### 6.2 Public Ledger

Options:
1. **OSF:** Timestamped registration
2. **Blockchain:** Ethereum smart contract with hash
3. **Notary:** Legal timestamped seal
4. **ArXiv:** Preprint with hash in abstract

**All four** recommended for maximum credibility

### 6.3 Commit-Reveal Process

**Commit Phase (before data):**
- Publish hash H = SHA-256(protocol details)
- Lock in analysis decisions

**Data Collection Phase:**
- Acquire data, keep sealed

**Analysis Phase:**
- Run pre-committed code
- No peeking at results until complete

**Reveal Phase:**
- Publish hash preimage + results simultaneously
- Community verifies hash matches

**Any deviation from pre-commitment must be:**
1. Documented with justification
2. Treated as exploratory (not confirmatory)
3. Clearly labeled in publication

---

## SECTION 7: POWER ANALYSIS

### 7.1 Sample Size Calculation

**Target:**
- Effect size: d = 0.01 (small but real)
- Power: 1 - β = 0.80
- Significance: α = 0.001 (3-sigma equivalent)

**Required sample size (per condition):**

$$
N = \frac{2(Z_\alpha + Z_\beta)^2}{d^2} \approx 100,000 \text{ blocks}
$$

**With 5 conditions (Rung A):** 500,000 blocks  
**With safety margin:** 1,000,000 blocks total

### 7.2 Expected Precision

At N = 100k per condition:

**Standard error on entropy:**

$$
SE(\hat{H}) = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}(H)}{N}} \approx \frac{0.001}{\sqrt{10^5}} \approx 3 \times 10^{-6}
$$

**95% CI width:** ~6 × 10⁻⁶ bits (excellent precision)

### 7.3 Stopping Rules

**Early Success:**
- If BF₁₀ > 10⁶ after 50% data: Stop, claim success
- But: Must complete planned replication

**Early Futility:**
- If BF₁₀ < 0.01 after 50% data and trending toward null: Stop
- Conditional power < 10%: Ethical to stop

**Both require independent Data Monitoring Committee approval**

Minimum requirements:
1. Internal: 3/3 replications successful
2. External: 2/3 labs successful
3. Meta BF > 10³
4. No evidence of fraud/error

## SECTION 12: RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### 12.1 Technical Risks

**Risk:** QRNG fails during run  
**Mitigation:** Hot spare unit, daily health checks, auto-restart

**Risk:** Temperature drift  
**Mitigation:** Climate-controlled room, continuous logging, covariate in model

**Risk:** EM interference  
**Mitigation:** Faraday cage, spectrum monitoring, correlation analysis

### 12.2 Conceptual Risks

**Risk:** Effect too small to detect  
**Mitigation:** Power analysis ensures 80% power for d=0.01; that's very sensitive

**Risk:** Effect exists but violates scaling law  
**Mitigation:** Pre-commit to non-parametric tests as backup

**Risk:** Rung A succeeds, Rung B fails  
**Mitigation:** Accept result, refine hypothesis about why Hebrew isn't special

### 12.3 Human Risks

**Risk:** Experimenter bias  
**Mitigation:** Blinding, automation, adversarial collaboration

**Risk:** Confirmation bias in analysis  
**Mitigation:** Pre-registered code, locked before data, third-party re-analysis

**Risk:** Publication bias  
**Mitigation:** Registered Report guarantees publication of null

---

## SECTION 13: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 13.1 Scientific Integrity

**Commitments:**
1. Pre-registration before data
2. No HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results Known)
3. Null results published with equal prominence
4. Errors corrected publicly

### 13.2 Broader Impacts

**If RCH is supported:**
- Profound implications for physics, consciousness studies, theology
- Media attention likely (prepared press release)
- Public outreach via accessible summary

**If RCH is refuted:**
- Equally important for science
- Demonstrates Logos framework makes falsifiable claims
- Informs future theoretical development

### 13.3 Dual-Use Concerns

**None identified** - this is basic research with no obvious weaponization potential

---

## CONCLUSION

This Registered Report presents a rigorous, falsifiable test of the Resonant Coupling Hypothesis using quantum random number generation. The 4-rung calibration ladder, null-model ensemble, cryptographic pre-commitment, and adversarial collaboration framework ensure that results—positive or negative—will be scientifically credible.

**The experiment is ready to begin.**
